dumps/results
1 - basic
2 - new normaliser for missing reads
3 - no recalibration (worse off, so reverted!)
4 - filtering out other DRBs 
5 - changed scoring system
6 - rank2 scoring now using ln(counts) rather than just counts for calculating scores - ABORTED and not submitted. Rubbish results
7 - Added weightings to value of each read hit based on ambiguity (1/log10(numGenesHit)) - Not as good!

Commits:

1 - prior to changing scoring system
	EDIT Actually in this commit, we're about to test the alternate DRB exclusion system. No change to scoring system yet

2 - changed scoring system (now 81+% sensitive)
